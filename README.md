I made many games on scratch when I was in 10th standard which eventually
increased my interest for game dev and game design along with mathematics and physics.
I'm currently learning godot to continue by journey in game dev. 
Have a look on some of the projects I made on scratch which taught me more about 
game design despite being a visual code platform scratch helped me grab some very important core game coding logictics. 
These projects are completely made by myself from art to visual code , everything.
